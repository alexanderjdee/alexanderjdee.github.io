      <p>
        Video games have always been my passion - I've been playing them for as long as I can remember. 
        I was drawn to the interactive story telling and immersion that can't be found in other forms of media. 
        It wasn't until a few years ago, when I was helping some friends with a game they were working on, that I realized my passion for video games extended beyond just playing them. 
        I wanted to make video games - to craft stories and experiences for others to enjoy just as much as I have.

        After I graduated from FIEA with a Master's in Interactive Entertainment, I worked for a year at EA on Madden 18. I am currently an Associate Producer at Bohemia Interactive Simulations.
        My goal for this boot camp is to further my technical skills, and transition to becoming a full stack developer.
